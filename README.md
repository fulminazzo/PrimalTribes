**PrimalTribes** had the idea of recreating a **team plugin**, a **clan plugin** and a **gang plugin**,
all in **one package**, with features distributed in submodules named **extensions**.

The project is now archived and the code is not usable (as the library for it is missing,
although one crazy enough could recreate it).

However, it was the first big project I ever worked on, so I felt like giving it a tribute.
